# onboarding

## Introduction
This repository serves to be a landing place for all the task related code submissions for onboarding to Bitshift Open Community. 

For code submissions, we would like to follow a set of Contribution Guidelines (like any other Open Source Organization), which would in turn make students aware about the importance of Contribution Guidelines in Open Source Projects.

We would thus encourage the students to follow the below mentioned points:

### Setting up the Repository
- Fork the [bitshiftlabs/onboarding](https://github.com/bitshiftlabs/onboarding) repository to your account and clone it. 
- Add upstream as bitshiftlabs/onboarding repo and perform `fetch`. You may use the following commands for your reference.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/onboarding.git
$ cd onboarding
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/bitshiftlabs/onboarding.git
$ git fetch --all
```

- ‚≠ê Switch to the branch which matches your first name, ex: switch to branch `vivek` if your name is `Vivek Nigam`. You will be making all the commits to this branch itself.

(For your convenience you may create additional branches with any name on you **forked repo** and merge them with your named branch later)

### Working on the tasks
- Keep a folder structure which is maintainable. One suggested structure is given below:

```bash
vivek
|-Task 1
|-Task 2
|-Task 3
|- 
```

Well of course, this is just a trivial suggestion and you are not pushed to use it strictly. You can freely use other better ways to organize your project :)

- ‚≠ê Make a Pull Request from `<your-username>/onboarding:<named-branch>` ‚Üí `bitshiftlabs/onboarding:<named-branch>` **after each task**, so that there can be a smooth workflow for code-reviews.
- Code reviews are an important part of an open-source organization environment, So
ü•Æ Brownie Points for reviewing other peer's code! **Hint:** You can find their code in their named branch.

**Enough said! It's time to dive into the actual exciting stuff.** 
### We wish you all the very best. May the source be with you! üôåüèª 
**Anything else on your mind?** Do let us know by mailing us [here](mailto:viveknigam.nigam3@gmail.com).
